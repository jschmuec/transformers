Transformers
===

Transformers is an experimental library to start playing
with the functional ideas of how to transform data simpler
and in a more maintainable form. In classic imperative
programs we have statements that are independent and can
not be analysed programmatically. This library replaces this
with dependency trees which can be used to create either
functions to manipulate data structures such as an XML
document or a map but also can return information about the
dependencies between the outputs and the inputs. A core
function of the later is that a human readable documentation
can be generated directly from the source code. _Or at least
that's the ambition._

[Here is a longer description of the generation.](doc/GenerateDocumentation.md)
